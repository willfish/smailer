# Smailer: S3 Inbox Reader

Smailer is a fun, space-themed CLI tool built in Go using the Charm libraries (Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, etc.) for a terminal user interface (TUI). It allows you to browse and read emails stored in an AWS S3 bucket (e.g., from SES inbound emails under a prefix like "inbound/"). Emails are parsed, displayed in a paginated table, and rendered nicely in Markdown format. Features include deletion with confirmation, dynamic layouts, and a cosmic splash screen.

## ‚ú® Features

- Pick a Bucket: If no `BUCKET` environment variable is set, it lists all S3 buckets (prioritizing those with "ses" in the name) for selection.
- Paginated Email List: Displays recent emails in a table with columns for From, To, Subject, and Date. Loads more on scroll (10 at a time).
- Email Viewing: Hit Enter to view the email body, rendered as styled Markdown (HTML emails converted via html-to-markdown and Glamour).
- Deletion: Press 'd' to delete from list or view, with a confirmation modal.

### Prerequisites

- AWS credentials configured (via `aws configure`, environment variables, or IAM roles)
- Permissions to manage an SES inbound s3 bucket
